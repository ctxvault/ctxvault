# CtxVault

AI work needs a source of truth outside the chat window.

CtxVault is a local context layer for preserving the decisions, constraints,
and working state that AI tools need to carry across sessions and workflows.

v0.3 is the compiled Context Injection milestone. It takes reviewed project
docs, sessions, and Markdown notes, compiles current workstream state, and
projects that context into AI work surfaces with receipts.

This public repository exposes the deterministic trust floor behind that loop:

- file-backed local objects
- deterministic policy, privacy, and receipt surfaces
- CLI and MCP entry points over the same local core
- review-gated promotion and projection receipts
- experimental compiled workstream state
- read-only local diagnostics
- Markdown-vault import bridge
- experimental projection healthchecks and runtime receipts
- public schemas, fixtures, and deterministic tests

## Official Project

This repository is the maintainer-controlled public core for `ctxvault`.

Official releases, schemas, fixtures, compatibility checks, and any signed or
notarized app artifacts, if provided, are published only through
maintainer-controlled CtxVault channels. Forks and integrations are welcome
under the Apache-2.0 core license, but unofficial builds should use distinct
names and should not imply maintainer endorsement.

This repository does not include the private first-party workbench, webapp,
native wrapper source, signing operations, notarization operations, release
operations, or brand assets. Those remain separate product layers.

## Scope

The public core is for users who want to inspect or build on:

- reviewed context organization around workstreams
- context injection into practical working surfaces
- local context storage and rebuildable indexes
- deterministic review-gated promotion flows
- local privacy and policy gates
- artifact and receipt surfaces
- compiled current workstream state with source refs
- Markdown-vault import as source material
- read-only projection adapter healthchecks
- optional local snapshot/replica backup writes

The public core currently marks these contracts as experimental:

- `src/ctxvault/intelligence.py`
- `Episode`
- `Workstream`
- compiled workstream state read model
- `doctor` report
- plugin manifest and projection receipt contracts
- the first local plugin executor paths for context injection targets
- projection adapter healthchecks
- runtime event receipts

Experimental means they are useful and inspectable, but not yet frozen as
long-term public semantics.

## v0.3 Compiled Context

v0.3 focuses on a sharper product path:

- import project docs, sessions, and Markdown notes
- organize them around reviewed `Workstream` state
- compile current truth, open questions, decisions, warnings, and source refs
- inject that state into `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and a workstream brief
- inspect projection receipts and read-only diagnostics

This is the same source-to-context-to-projection loop from M1, now made denser
with compiled current state and explicit health visibility.

CtxVault remains a local context layer for AI work, not a single-harness memory
plugin. ChatGPT, Claude.ai, DeepSeek, local Ollama-style UIs, Claude Code,
Codex, Cursor, shell traces, project notes, and rules files can all be source
or target surfaces over time. Current named-source support is explicit:
normalized transcript import where stable, and experimental adapters only where
marked as such.

## Quick Start

Run deterministic checks:

```bash
python3 scripts/run_deterministic_checks.py
```

Run the clean-user core validation flow:

```bash
bash scripts/run_clean_user_core_validation.sh /tmp/ctxvault-clean-verify
```

Emit reviewed context projections:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m ctxvault.cli emit-agents-projection --root /tmp/ctxvault-clean-verify --workstream-id ws_20260421_ctxvault_schema --output-path exports/AGENTS.md --receipt-output-path artifacts/agents-md-receipt.json
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m ctxvault.cli emit-claude-projection --root /tmp/ctxvault-clean-verify --workstream-id ws_20260421_ctxvault_schema --output-path exports/CLAUDE.md --receipt-output-path artifacts/claude-md-receipt.json
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m ctxvault.cli emit-wiki-projection --root /tmp/ctxvault-clean-verify --workstream-id ws_20260421_ctxvault_schema --output-path exports/workstream.md --receipt-output-path artifacts/workstream-md-receipt.json
```

Build compiled workstream state:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m ctxvault.cli compiled-workstream-state --root /tmp/ctxvault-clean-verify --workstream-id ws_20260421_ctxvault_schema
```

Import a Markdown vault as source material:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m ctxvault.cli markdown-vault-import --root /tmp/ctxvault-clean-verify --vault-path /path/to/notes --scope-kind project --scope-value ctxvault
```

Run read-only diagnostics:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m ctxvault.cli doctor --root /tmp/ctxvault-clean-verify
```

Run read-only projection adapter healthchecks:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m ctxvault.cli adapter-healthcheck --root /tmp/ctxvault-clean-verify --target-kind agents-md --target-path exports/AGENTS.md
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m ctxvault.cli adapter-healthcheck --root /tmp/ctxvault-clean-verify --target-kind claude-md --target-path exports/CLAUDE.md
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m ctxvault.cli adapter-healthcheck --root /tmp/ctxvault-clean-verify --target-kind workstream-brief --target-path exports/workstream.md
```

Write an optional local snapshot/replica backup to an explicit local target:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m ctxvault.cli local-backup-write --root /tmp/ctxvault-clean-verify --target file:///tmp/ctxvault-clean-verify-backup --label "local backup rehearsal" --device-id local-target
```

Inspect the default runtime layout:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m ctxvault.cli print-layout
```

Initialize a local vault:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m ctxvault.cli init-vault
```

Run the stdio MCP transport:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m ctxvault.cli serve-mcp
```

## Context Injection M1 Evidence

Run the source-to-injection golden path:

```bash
python3 scripts/run_context_injection_m1_golden_path.py --root /tmp/ctxvault-m1-context-injection
```

The checked-in M1 fixture evidence is in:

- `fixtures/context-injection-m1/projections/AGENTS.md`
- `fixtures/context-injection-m1/projections/CLAUDE.md`
- `fixtures/context-injection-m1/projections/workstream-brief.md`
- `fixtures/context-injection-m1/projections/agents-md-receipt.json`
- `fixtures/context-injection-m1/projections/claude-md-receipt.json`
- `fixtures/context-injection-m1/projections/workstream-brief-receipt.json`
- `fixtures/m1-context-injection/README.md`

## v0.3 Evidence

The v0.3 compiled Context Injection evidence is described in:

- `docs/v0.3-compiled-context.md`
- `docs/v0.3-release-notes.md`
- `docs/v0.2-m2-developer-framework.md`
- `docs/v0.2-m2-compatibility-evidence.md`
- `docs/v0.2-m2-release-notes.md`

The local backup write path is optional local durability. It creates a governed
snapshot, copies the snapshot manifest, restore bundle, and sync manifest into
an explicit local target, and verifies the target as a replica before reporting
success. It does not make a hosted service the source of truth and does not
replace a separate offsite backup strategy.
