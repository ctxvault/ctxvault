# CtxVault

Status: v0.5.0 public release artifact.

Know what your AI tools see.

Governed context projection for AI work.

CtxVault v0.4.0 is a local, reviewable, receipt-backed AI work context handoff
package. It turns local project sources into safe, receipt-backed handoffs for AI tools, agents, and coding workflows while keeping source evidence, scope, review state, and receipts inspectable.

Category: the local trust layer for AI work.

It preserves decisions, constraints, and working state as local evidence that
must be reviewed before it influences an AI work surface.

v0.5.0 adds a public, receipt-bound proof scene for governed context
projection. Reviewed evidence, decisions, caveats, and receipts can be rendered
into portable context packets for AI tools, agents, and coding workflows.

Boundary phrase for publication review: no target repository writes and no provider/model execution.

The v0.5.0 proof scene is deterministic and local: one private dogfood path
plus three owner-selected OSS dry-runs. The public release exposes aggregate
metrics and a sanitized example, not raw private receipts, repo-local paths,
specific source excerpts, or target repository writes.

Across the three OSS dry-runs, CtxVault produced 121 candidates, caveated 20,
blocked 101, verified manifests, passed target-profile dry-runs, and kept
target writes disabled. These dry-runs do not claim benchmark, leaderboard,
reliability, runtime, adapter, provider/model, hardware, cost, security, or
automatic repository optimization results.

v0.4.0 packages the deterministic context handoff path as a complete local
trust-and-handoff release. The public core still centers on local source
extraction, context selection, receipt inspection, and projection before
context reaches AI tools:

`local sources -> context-extract -> context slices -> privacy and quality receipts -> gated projection -> receipt inspection`

The baseline is intentionally constrained: no model call, no embedding service,
no vector database, no remote provider. The value is that the operator can see
which sources were imported, which local context was selected, why it was
allowed or blocked, how large it is, and which receipt links it to an AI work
surface.

The core control question is not how much an agent remembers. It is which past
context is allowed to influence the next AI work surface, with what source
evidence, scope, review state, and receipt. v0.4.0 adds a static Receipt/Trust
Gallery and clearer demo/review materials while keeping optional Workbench UX
and native wrapper source outside the open-core package.

v0.4.1 is an experimental, non-normative Projection Governance Kernel design
preview. It explains the object model behind reviewed context handoff: source
evidence becomes candidate context, review decisions govern projection rights,
and receipts record selected, omitted, blocked, written, and not-done states.
It is not shipped v0.4.0 behavior, not a stable external API, and not runtime
behavior.

This public repository exposes the deterministic trust floor behind that
source-to-context-to-projection loop:

- local file-backed objects and rebuildable indexes
- CLI and MCP entry points over the same deterministic core
- review-gated promotion and projection receipts
- experimental compiled workstream state with source refs
- deterministic context slicing and local context search
- source-grouped context selection with token budget previews
- one-command local extraction from static source exports and Markdown vaults
- stable source fingerprints and idempotency keys for extraction runs
- deterministic context-quality, density, retrieval-gain, source-retention,
  search-trace, and source-conflict receipts
- selected-slice privacy preflight before projection
- projection receipts linked to context-selection receipts
- human-readable receipt inspection for extract, selection, privacy, quality,
  and projection chains
- owner-operated public review pack with reusable public-source scenarios,
  boundary checks, and a synthetic blocked-selection check
- read-only doctor diagnostics and projection healthchecks
- Markdown-vault import as source material
- review-gated logical purge for derived slice, search, preview, and selected
  projection data
- public schemas, fixtures, and deterministic tests
- experimental v0.4.1 Projection Governance Kernel design-preview docs,
  schema, fixtures, and focused tests
- v0.5.0 public release artifacts, aggregate local OSS dry-run evidence, and a
  sanitized governed context projection example

## Official Project

This repository is the maintainer-controlled public core for `ctxvault`.

Official releases, schemas, fixtures, and compatibility checks are published
only through maintainer-controlled CtxVault channels. Forks and integrations
are welcome under the Apache-2.0 core license, but unofficial builds should use
distinct names and should not imply maintainer endorsement.

This repository contains the public deterministic core. Optional product
surfaces and maintainer release operations remain outside this repo.

## Scope

The public core is for developers who want to inspect or build on:

- reviewed context organization around workstreams
- context projection into practical AI working surfaces
- local context storage and rebuildable indexes
- deterministic review-gated promotion flows
- local privacy and policy gates
- artifact and receipt surfaces
- early source-of-truth and evidence semantics for future AI work quality
  contracts
- compiled current workstream state with source refs
- local context slice rebuild, search, and selected-slice preflight
- explicit logical purge of derived data without a secure-wipe claim
- Markdown-vault import as source material
- read-only projection adapter healthchecks
- optional local snapshot/replica backup writes
- deterministic context extraction from static local exports
- receipt inspection for human review before sharing context

The public core currently marks these contracts as experimental:

- `src/ctxvault/intelligence.py`
- `Episode`
- `Workstream`
- compiled workstream state read model
- `doctor` report
- plugin manifest and projection receipt contracts
- the first local plugin executor paths for reviewed context projection targets
- projection adapter healthchecks
- runtime event receipts
- context selection receipts
- context extraction receipts
- context quality and scorecard receipts
- v0.4.1 Projection Governance Kernel design-preview schema and fixtures

Experimental means useful and inspectable, but not yet frozen as long-term
public semantics.

## v0.5.0 Governed Context Projection

v0.5.0 narrows the public claim to governed context projection for AI work:

`reviewed evidence -> decisions and caveats -> portable context packets -> receipts`

This release demonstrates the shape with public-safe aggregate evidence and a
sanitized example. It does not publish private dogfood receipts, private local
paths, raw source excerpts, provider/model outputs, or target repository
writes.

Mechanism notes:

- `docs/mechanism/governed-context-projection.md`
- `docs/mechanism/governed-context-projection.zh.md`
- `release/v0.5.0/mechanism-note-governed-context-projection.md`
- `release/v0.5.0/mechanism-note-governed-context-projection.zh.md`

Allowed wording:

- reviewed evidence, decisions, caveats, and receipts can become portable
  context packets for AI tools, agents, and coding workflows
- the proof scene includes CtxVault dogfood plus owner-selected local OSS
  dry-runs
- the dry-runs performed no hidden scan, no provider/model call, no adapter
  execution, no runtime execution, no memory promotion, and no target writes

Not claimed:

- benchmark or leaderboard results
- reliability, accuracy, or coding-performance improvement
- adapter, runtime, provider/model, or hardware/cost compatibility
- automatic repository optimization
- stable Memory Governance Protocol
- Memory OS, RAG replacement, hallucination prevention, or security
  certification

## v0.4.1 Projection Governance Kernel Design Preview

v0.4.1 is a docs/schema/fixture/test design preview. It makes the projection
control point explicit:

`source evidence -> candidate context -> review decision -> projection -> receipt`

The design preview is experimental and non-normative. It does not ship runtime
gate wiring, Workbench review UX, provider or model execution, live package or
registry checks, external memory adapters, durable memory consolidation,
stable external APIs, public beta readiness, benchmark claims, hallucination
prevention, Memory OS, or unified agent memory.

## v0.3.5 First-Run UX Boundary

v0.3.5 records the private Workbench UX patch over v0.3.4. The Workbench can
make first-run extract and inject easier for the maintainer-operated product
surface, but the public open-core package does not ship that UI and does not
claim runtime control.

The public boundary for this release is:

- CtxVault prepares receipt-backed handoff context
- agent runtimes such as Codex or Claude Code remain user-controlled
- no running session is attached, controlled, inspected, or impersonated
- demo data is explicit fixture seeding, not automatic private-data import
- Git worktree creation, SSE progress, and runtime inventory remain roadmap
  items, not shipped public behavior

## v0.3.4 Context Extract And Quality Receipts

v0.3.4 is a release-experience cut over the safe handoff path. It does not add
model, embedding, vector, remote provider, official plugin, live connector, or
public Workbench dependencies. It makes the first useful trial shorter:

- run `context-extract --dry-run` to fingerprint sources and preview imports
  without writing governed objects
- run `context-extract` to import static local sources, rebuild slices, prepare
  context, and optionally project when the handoff is ready
- inspect the newest receipt chain with `receipt-inspect --latest --summary`
- verify stale source fingerprints, missing selection receipts, projection
  links, and blocked extraction runs with read-only `doctor`
- run deterministic quality and stability scorecards before making public
  quality claims
- keep projection gated by `handoff_ready`, privacy preflight, and token-budget
  checks

## v0.3.3 Safe Context Handoff

v0.3.3 is a hardening release over the v0.3.2 composer. It does not add model,
embedding, vector, remote provider, official plugin, live connector, or public
Workbench dependencies. It makes the public path easier to verify:

- run the public review pack from reusable public-source scenario fixtures
- prepare exact local slices with `context-prepare`
- inspect `selection_status`, `handoff_ready`, budget state, warnings, blocked
  reasons, and receipt paths
- project approved selected slices with `context-project`
- verify the projection receipt and linked context-selection receipt
- confirm the synthetic secret fixture is withheld and blocks projection when
  explicitly selected

## v0.3.2 Context Selection Composer

v0.3.2 is a fast-follow release after v0.3.1. It does not add model,
embedding, vector, remote provider, official plugin, or live connector
dependencies. It adds the deterministic step that should happen before context
is projected into an AI work surface: choose exact local slices, inspect the
budget, run privacy preflight, and keep the receipt chain.

- source-grouped local context candidate composition
- explicit multi-slice selection
- token budget preview
- target-aware privacy preflight for selected slices
- `ctxvault.context-selection-receipt/v1`
- projection receipts linked to context selection receipts
- local pin, hide, and archive preferences for slice suggestions
- CLI and MCP tools over the same deterministic core

## v0.3.1 Local Safety And Context Slicing

v0.3.1 keeps the v0.3 source-to-context-to-projection path and adds the local
safety substrate needed for safer context selection:

- import project docs, sessions, and Markdown notes
- organize them around reviewed `Workstream` state
- compile current truth, open questions, decisions, warnings, and source refs
- rebuild deterministic local context slices from governed sources
- search slices locally without model, embedding, remote service, or hosted API
- run privacy preflight before selected slices are projected
- project that state into `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and a workstream brief
- inspect projection receipts, privacy preflight receipts, logical purge
  receipts, tombstones, and read-only diagnostics

This is the same source-to-context-to-projection loop from M1, now made denser
with compiled current state and explicit health visibility.

CtxVault remains a local context layer for AI work, not a single-harness memory
plugin. ChatGPT, Claude.ai, DeepSeek, local model UIs, Claude Code,
Codex, Cursor, shell traces, project notes, and rules files can all be source
or target surfaces over time. Current named-source support is explicit:
normalized transcript import where stable, and experimental adapters only where
marked as such.

## Quick Start

Run deterministic checks:

```bash
python3 scripts/run_deterministic_checks.py
```

Run the v0.4.0 local context handoff trial:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=src
python3 scripts/run_v040_context_handoff_trial.py --root /tmp/ctxvault-v040-trial --reset
```

Start with the generated human report:

```text
/tmp/ctxvault-v040-trial/artifacts/v0.4.0-first-run-report.md
```

Try the same handoff path on your own local repo without writing projections
back into that repo:

```bash
python3 scripts/run_v040_real_repo_trial.py --repo /path/to/your/repo --root /tmp/ctxvault-v040-real-repo-trial --reset
```

Run the repeatability check through the same v0.4.0 public entrypoint:

```bash
python3 scripts/run_v040_context_handoff_trial.py --root /tmp/ctxvault-v040-repeatability --reset
```

Lower-level v0.3.4 scorecard scripts remain available for regression evidence,
but the public v0.4.0 trial entrypoint above is the default path to run first.

Run the v0.3.3 public package review pack:

```bash
python3 scripts/run_v033_public_review_pack.py --root /tmp/ctxvault-v033-public-review --force
```

Start with the generated human report:

```text
/tmp/ctxvault-v033-public-review/artifacts/v0.3.3-public-review/owner-review.md
/tmp/ctxvault-v033-public-review/artifacts/v0.3.3-public-review/owner-review.html
```

```

Rebuild and search deterministic local context slices:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m ctxvault.cli context-slice-rebuild --root /tmp/ctxvault-clean-verify
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m ctxvault.cli context-search --root /tmp/ctxvault-clean-verify --query "projection receipts"
```

Run selected-slice privacy preflight before projecting a slice into a target:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m ctxvault.cli context-selection-preflight --root /tmp/ctxvault-clean-verify --slice-ref SLICE_REF --target-kind agents-md --write-receipt
```

Compose selected local slices with a budget preview and a selection receipt:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m ctxvault.cli context-selection-compose --root /tmp/ctxvault-clean-verify --query "projection receipts" --target-kind harness.agents-md --slice-ref SLICE_REF --token-budget 1200 --write-receipt
```

PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m ctxvault.cli adapter-healthcheck --root /tmp/ctxvault-clean-verify --target-kind claude-md --target-path exports/CLAUDE.md
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m ctxvault.cli adapter-healthcheck --root /tmp/ctxvault-clean-verify --target-kind workstream-brief --target-path exports/workstream.md
```

Write an optional local snapshot/replica backup to an explicit local target:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m ctxvault.cli local-backup-write --root /tmp/ctxvault-clean-verify --target /tmp/ctxvault-clean-verify-backup --label "local backup rehearsal" --device-id local-target

## v0.4.0 Evidence

The v0.4.1 Projection Governance Kernel design preview, v0.4.0 local
trust-and-handoff release, v0.3.5 first-run UX boundary, v0.3.4 context

The local backup write path is optional local durability. It creates a governed
snapshot, copies the snapshot manifest, restore bundle, and sync manifest into
an explicit local target, and verifies the target as a replica before reporting
success. It does not make a hosted service the source of truth and does not
replace a separate offsite backup strategy.

## Feedback

The most useful feedback is concrete: what you ran, what confused you, and
which receipt, slice, projection, or workflow step was hard to trust.

Feedback is separated by evidence level:

- ordinary issues are for bugs, wording gaps, install friction, and general
  trust questions;
- first 10 minutes trial reports capture the first activation path and the
  first blocker, but may be self-reported;
- non-author controlled trial evidence uses
  `release/v0.4.0/trials/controlled-trial-record.template.md` and is the only
  feedback category that can support later public beta readiness claims.
